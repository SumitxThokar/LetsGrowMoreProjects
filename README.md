## Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset

The task was to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset on terrorism, with the goal of identifying the hot zones for terrorism. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I was able to determine that the hot zones for terrorism are the Middle East & North Africa and South Asia, with Iran having the highest number of terrorism victims.<br>

## Image to Pencil Sketch with Python
Utilizing the powerful Python library OpenCV, I was able to convert an RBG image into a stunning pencil sketch. The result of the project can be seen in the accompanying image. OpenCV is a powerful library that allows developers to perform a wide range of image processing and computer vision tasks. I was able to harness the capabilities of this library to turn an ordinary image into a visually striking pencil sketch, showcasing the versatility and potential of image processing with the help of OpenCV.

## Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
The task at hand was to classify the species of Iris Flowers using a supervised machine learning algorithm. I employed the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, as the independent variable was of a discrete type. The KNN model is a non-parametric supervised learning classifier that uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. Utilizing features such as the length and width of the Sepal and Petals, I was able to classify the species with an impressive accuracy of 95.55%.
